# Install + Configure Commit Workflow

## 🔑 Ensuring a Proper SSH Key for GitHub

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys:**

   ```sh
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```

   Look for `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`.

2. **Generate a New Key (if needed):**

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Press Enter to accept defaults.

3. **Add Key to SSH Agent:**

   ```sh
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Add Public Key to GitHub:**

    - Copy key:
      ```sh
      pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
      ```
    - Go to [GitHub SSH keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys), click **New SSH key**, paste, and save.

5. **Set Remote to Use SSH:**

   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   ```

6. **Test Connection:**
   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   Should see:  
   `Hi YOUR_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`
